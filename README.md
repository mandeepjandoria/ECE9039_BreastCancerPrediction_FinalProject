>Breast cancer is the  second leading cause of death from cancer in Canadian women. More than 80% of deaths due to cancerous cells occurs in underdeveloped and developing countries. It is estimated that in year 2019, around 30,000 cases were diagnosed with breast cancer and 5000 in severe cases.

>This project will be built on Python programming language, using extensive list of libraries and tools. There are number of techniques, which will be employed in various stages of project, from exploratory data analysis, modelling and optimization

### How to view this project:
  1. Run BreastCancerPrediction.ipynb file in jupyter notebook
  2. Each module is developed seperately in accordance to the work flow described in final report.
  4. Each module in code depicts outcome based on tunable parameters.
  3. Final observations/explanation of outcomes for projects can be viewed in  are shared in report.

### Software and Libraries required
This project uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* Anaconda/Jupyter - for viewwing code and output
* sklearn - for modelling
* matplotlib - for data visualization
* seaborn - for data visualization
* Beautiful Soup - to implement the webscarpping
* numpy - to process the data
* pandas - to process the data
